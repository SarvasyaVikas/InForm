# InForm
InForm is a project designed to help students by providing automated personal training. We are starting with tennis serves, and creating a neural network analyzing form for serves by looking at tennis ball regression over time for top players from videos found on YouTube. The intended use of this application is for an athlete to record themselves doing a tennis serve and uploading it to the app, where it will be run through the network, its accuracy will be calculated, and feedback will be given to prevent sports injuries and helping athletes in low-income or rural areas.
